Life-Steal Fork:
----------------

* New game fee of 5 HUC for destruct.

* Hearts never spawn.

* At the fork, all hearts are removed and all hearted characters
  killed immediately.  Coins are handled as per disaster death.

* Death by disaster now refunds the general cost.  The collected coins
  are added to the game fund (minus miner tax).

* Destructing is not lethal for the hunter itself.

* Waypoints and destruct can be set at once in a valid move.
